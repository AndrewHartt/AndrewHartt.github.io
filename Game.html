                First and foremost I wish to thank the Chirs Courses youtube channel and the tutorial he has on his channel on how to make this game in HTML and Javascript.
                I am very passionate about video games and making video games however I lack a lot of the experience and knowledge required to make games in HTML and Javascript. 
                I would not have been able to make the fully functional game seen below without the help of the tutorial form the Chris Courses youtube channel which is linked below with the tutorial video on how to make this game in HTML.
                The game you see below is almost entirely from his tutorial, I have changed a few aspects such as various speeds of enemies, projectiles, and explosions on hit but outside of a few features the base game remains the same as the game form the tutorial.
                I highly recommend checking out his channel and content, it is almost all related to game development in HTML and Javascript. He has amazing content and some of the most in depth explanations on coding tutorials I have watched. 
                He has tutorials depicting all sorts of topics in games like creating multi-room platformers, recreating a pokemon game, recreating space invaders, making a tower defnese game, making a fighting game, etc, all through HTML and Javascript.
